# PredictiveMaintenance-1DCNN-Azure
By [Sara San Luis](https://github.com/xoubinha) and [Daniela Solis](https://github.com/Danysolism)

This project presents a predictive maintenance solution for failure prediction in hydraulic pipe systems. For every predefined period of time (cycle) we will predict if the cooler system is close to failing using temperature sensors. The model will predict if the system is close to total failure, it has reduced efficiency or full efficiency. 



### Dataset
The dataset used was the [Condition monitoring of hydraulic systems](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Condition+monitoring+of+hydraulic+systems#) from UCI repository
